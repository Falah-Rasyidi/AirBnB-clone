## General Info
Basic AirBnB clone for Database Applications assignment 3.

For each booking, their corresponding listing was injected into the booking via a referencing approach. This was primarily because bookings weren't going to be retrieved at all after being created (in the context of this assignment).

## Technologies
* React.js
* Express.js
* Node.js
* MongoDB

## Setup
Install npm packages by running `npm install` in the terminal.

Then, run `npm start` to launch the website on localhost. In another terminal, run `node server.js` to launch the Express.js server.

The website and server reside on ports 3000 and 5000 respectively.
